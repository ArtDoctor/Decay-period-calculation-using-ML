# Decay period calculation using ML
This jupyter notebook resembles my attempts to create a model that predicts a half-life decay using nucleus's characteristics.

This is mainly for educational purposes, and I just experiment here with data, trying to create a good model using my knowledge acquired from different courses.

Right only amounts of protons and neutrons used as a features, but in future I'll try to find different dataset with more important information, for example - energy of decay.
